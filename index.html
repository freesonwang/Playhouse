	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Freeson Wang, and you've stumbled across my little corner of the internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2011 majoring in computer science, minoring in art. I've
		also worked at Microsoft and Pixar. I'm currently applying to be a graduate student of computer science at Stanford.

		<h3>Playhouse</h3>
		<p>
			PLAYHOUSE is a modern, simple, and elegant WebGL application.
			PLAYHOUSE is made with Javascript, using the MooTools framework, and KnockoutJS and WebGL libraries. Although, this started out
			as an exercise in learning WebGL, I decided to codify my learning a little more coherently into an 
			actual application representing my vision for an easy-to-use, easy-to-learn, and pretty 3D creation application.
		</p>
		<p>
			Comes with these great features:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add and delete models from the stage!</li>
			<li>Color your models!</li>
			<li>Move your models!</li>
			<li>Texture your models!</li>
			<li>Basic lighting and shading is supported!</li>
			<li>Load OBJ models from popular video games such as <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Portal</em>, and <em>Assassin's Creed</em>!</li>
